# Universal Image Data Augmentation

Many image data augmentation are implemented in specific framework that are not capable to be used in other code. This is a repo that can apply augmentation methods with framework free, so you can augment your own images at ease

## Usage

Use command `python app.y` to run the code, source image data shall be in `./src` while output would be in `./dst`

## Methods

Right now I have only implemented several augmentation methods, I will add more when I can spare some time, so please stay tuned. If you want to contribute for this repo, any pull requests are welcome.
